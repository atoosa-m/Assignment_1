## Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study
**Newton Crypto Ltd**, or **Newton**, is a Canadian-born cryptocurrency exchange platform established by Dustin Walper, Erynn Saunders and Tyson Leslie in 2018. The Newton team of experts created this platform to assist other exchanges in the struggle to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible to Canadian traders. Simply put, Newton’s main goal is to target the Canadian market. It is known as one of the most beginner-friendly cryptocurrency exchange platforms. On August 30, 2018 Newton announced that it has entered into a partnership with DVX Capital Markets, an affiliate of DV Trading and DV Chain, and the parent company of Independent Trading Group ("ITG"), a Canadian broker dealer regulated by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC). This partnership raised a total of $15M in funding for Newton, as well as significant financial, technological and intellectual resources. Since then, the company has seen explosive growth. As of January 2021, their customer base grew by an eye-popping 400%. They achieved a five-million-dollar trading day and moved their bottom line from red to black two months in a row; landing squarely in profit territory. They now serve over 200,000 users.

Customer data at Newton is stored in Canada, they are fully PIPEDA-compliant and have an exportable T5 statement of investment income. In terms of safety and security technologies, they use cold storage devices to keep cryptocurrency holdings as secure as possible and make daily off-site backups. When it comes to KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, Newton are partnered with PLAID, a Canadian security management company, using their direct bank integration. 
Newton is fully FINTRAC (Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada) regulated and must comply with their set of operating rules including AML (Anti Money Laundering) and CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism) regulations. This transparency and compliance has won the hearts of local traders and investors.

For any cryptocurrency exchange, the two most important factors are the coins on offer and the fee structure; Newton’s main appeal is the latter. Newton does not charge any money to deposit funds, and they do not have a flat fee attached to every trade. However, Newton is still a business. Any time one currency is exchanged for another currency, it makes money. These prices may vary; however, the spreads are typically within the range of 0.5% or 1% of the total price.
Other than no trading fees the company highlights some features that make them stand out, including third-party custody, high liquidity, and competitive spreads. They conduct daily off-site backups, offer institutional-grade storage software for digital assets, and have direct bank integration. Within this industry making sure that money enters and exits the exchange smoothly is a difficult thing to do well and Newton has exceeded particularly well in that department.

## Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study
**Newton Crypto Ltd**, or **Newton**, is a Canadian-born cryptocurrency exchange platform established by Dustin Walper, Erynn Saunders and Tyson Leslie in 2018. The Newton team of experts created this platform to assist other exchanges in the struggle to make cryptocurrency trading more accessible to Canadian traders. Simply put, Newtonâ€™s main goal is to target the Canadian market. It is known as one of the most beginner-friendly cryptocurrency exchange platforms. On August 30, 2018 Newton announced that it has entered into a partnership with DVX Capital Markets, an affiliate of DV Trading and DV Chain, and the parent company of Independent Trading Group ("ITG"), a Canadian broker dealer regulated by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC). This partnership raised a total of $15M in funding for Newton, as well as significant financial, technological and intellectual resources. Since then, the company has seen explosive growth. As of January 2021, their customer base grew by an eye-popping 400%. They achieved a five-million-dollar trading day and moved their bottom line from red to black two months in a row; landing squarely in profit territory. They now serve over 200,000 users.
